# GO was created by Google in 2007 and open-sourced in 2009 (relatively new)
# Why go, use cases:
    # Can do multiple things at once (multi-threading/concurrency) --> Google Drive editing, watching a YouTube video and scrolling
        # infrastructure changed a lot (cloud computing, microprocessors) --> more scalable & distributed
    # performance
# Tries to combine performane of C++ with the simplicity of Python
# Is a compiled language --> it can compile into a single binary and be run on other platforms

# Discover errors at compile time, NOT run time
